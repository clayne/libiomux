- when using the epoll backend (HAVE_EPOLL) make also use of timerfd to implement timers and fd-timeouts
  (instead of the internal pqueue-based implementation).
- check for pending input/output when a new fd is added to the mux (via iomux_add())
  instead of waiting for the next iomux_run() cycle before the new fd is taken into account
